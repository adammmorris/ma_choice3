So far it seems like he does not care about any category, I suspected the person might like plot, but then the person would not choose it,
Then I thought the person might like an overall well made movie and prefer the one movie with the best overall score. Again this was the case but then he would randomly pick lower scoring ones. 
I tried to isolate a single category and find a reason. Was it Humor, action, plot, Romance, but I can't find any pattern because the person is too wishy washy
Sometimes the person will pick a movie because it has the best overall scores, or sometimes he will pick a movie that has the highest score in one category and randomly he will choose a poor performing movie
This person is too chaotic and he hurt my logic seeking brain. 
There might be a pattern the person used but the person used different strategies  ","No, despite whatever they answered in the survey, I firmly believe that the participant was a inconsistent person who constantly changed their strategy they would sometimes pick the movie with the best over all scores but would then randomly choose the movie with the lower overall score. Sometimes they pick the movie with the highest scores and then choose a mediocre on, I could not find one or two categories that they liked that they would prefer this person is too random.
I need a computer that can tally his scores and perform advance statistical analysis to even see if it could even find any pattern or logic.

One was the overall good/bad rating of each individual title. Very good would dramatically improve the desirableness of a certain title as expected and very bad would do the opposite. The more ratings of moderate, good, and very good for factors of a movie overall increases the likelihood of that one being chosen. Likewise, the more negative ratings on average a movie has per each factor increases the likelihood of it not to be chosen. Occasionally, when nearly all factors of a movie were rated negative or positive, but one specifically was rated very good/ very bad, it could tip the decision to one or the other. For some reason, I felt that I noticed the acting and creativity categories carried more weight than the others at times. Therefore, I tried to base my decisions off of the final ratings of those two categories compared to all of the others.

If the two movies were on even footing in regards to these four factors, it seems the other factors were then considered, with the movie having a higher average rating across all factors generally being the one that was selected.

In situations where the values were closer, I tried to get a sense for their preferences by analyzing which factors they seemed to prioritize.

I then formed a model in my head of their prioritization, and I evaluated future trials in accordance with this model to see if it could successfully predict which movie they'd select. Through trial and error, I refined my process until I could reliably predict which movie they'd select.

I also suspect that the subject tried to guess which categories went together as well.

I'd probably describe it as them usually, but not always, favoring movies with higher overall scores, followed by movies with better dialogue/visuals/soundtrack/acting. Of those four factors, I think they probably favored some over others, and I also think that, at least to some extent, they cared about how much more highly those factors were rated not just that they were rated higher. I think their strategy did change some on certain trials though.",I just paid as much attention as I could to those trials to try to work out which factors they were favoring over time. I paid special attention to trials where they picked a movie I didn't expect them to though because I figured those trials could best inform me about how I was wrong about their strategy up to that point.,62,38,,75,100,1-5,33,Yes,More than 5 years,20,30,Yes,I have an extensive amount of experience with mindfulness meditation.,,,,,,,"{""VR.4"":""5"",""VR.16"":""It is impossible to tell"",""VR.17"":""47"",""VR.19"":""Sunday"",""LN.7"":""X"",""LN.33"":""G"",""LN.34"":""X"",""LN.58"":""N"",""MX.45"":""E"",""MX.46"":""B"",""MX.47"":""B"",""MX.55"":""D"",""R3D.3"":""F"",""R3D.4"":""D"",""R3D.6"":""F"",""R3D.8"":""D""}","[""LN.7"",""LN.33"",""LN.34"",""LN.58"",""MX.45"",""MX.46"",""MX.47"",""MX.55"",""R3D.6"",""VR.4"",""VR.16"",""VR.17"",""VR.19""]",13,"No, I wasn't suspicious about anything.",Yes,,"{""strategy"":252434,""consistency2"":34664,""binatts_q_comp1"":18800,""binatts_q_comp2"":28136,""binatts_q_real"":26124,""binatts_q_norm"":21632,""lex_q_comp1"":24477,""lex_q_comp2"":13060,""lex_q_real"":8090,""lex_q_norm"":13105,""binwts_q_comp1"":27366,""binwts_q_comp2"":17098,""binwts_q_real"":8524,""binwts_q_norm"":10210,""consistency1"":26154,""appropriateness"":20049,""strategy2"":173084,""confidence"":26100,""metastrategy"":96703,""attention"":7297,""choice_domain"":12706,""choice_exp"":7568,""icar"":1028180}",I will complete this study with my full attention.,Woman,,"[""White""]",4 year degree,"$50,000 - $65,000",Yes,"Yes, I am okay with my answers to these questions ",It took longer than advertised.

This much was a given. In cases where movies were comparatively middling or bad, I believe I saw a tendency for the user to prioritize creativity, dialogue, and visuals more than other factors.

Some movies were chosen because they scored high marks in creativity, visuals, soundtrack, and other aesthetic/experiential options, even while core elements such as the acting or dialogue were rated as bad. High humor, action scene, or romance ratings on an otherwise poorly-measured movie were sometimes enough to deem it the better choice, but rarely. A strong plot alone often wasn't enough to justify being chosen.

I think the user believed that high ratings in certain categories determined what kind of movie it'd be, so you can assume that a romance movie with high romance rating is performing its task well. That should automatically convey that it would be a pleasant experience to watch. I can't be certain if these perceived biases and subsequent choices were influenced by the user's personal tastes.","I think that the user's own set guidelines for how they decided which movie to choose did indeed change from trial to trial. It would explain why they sometimes leaned towards otherwise bad movies with strong action or romance scenes, but seemingly ignored those values when judging other movies.","I believe I saw tendencies in which choices they gravitated towards, all within the same vein of aesthetic visuals, creativity, etc. There was consistency to it, which told me that they prioritized certain elements of movies over others when making their decisions.

The exception, to me, is that they sometimes changed their opinion about what mattered. This tended to happen when both movies were aesthetically bad overall, but had some strong element that might carry them: action scenes to suggest it's an action movie, romantic scenes to suggest it's romance, humor to suggest a comedy, and so on.",33,72,,86,74,15+,0,No,,,,,,,,,,,,"{""VR.4"":""5"",""VR.16"":""It is impossible to tell"",""VR.17"":""47"",""VR.19"":""Sunday"",""LN.7"":""X"",""LN.33"":""G"",""LN.34"":""X"",""LN.58"":""N"",""MX.45"":""D"",""MX.46"":""A"",""MX.47"":""B"",""MX.55"":""D"",""R3D.3"":""C"",""R3D.4"":""B"",""R3D.6"":""F"",""R3D.8"":""G""}","[""LN.7"",""LN.33"",""LN.34"",""LN.58"",""MX.47"",""MX.55"",""R3D.3"",""R3D.4"",""R3D.6"",""R3D.8"",""VR.4"",""VR.16"",""VR.17"",""VR.19""]",14,I wondered for a long time if the person making the choices wasn't just choosing randomly.,Yes,,"{""strategy"":782201,""binwts_q_comp1"":21431,""binwts_q_comp2"":12524,""binwts_q_real"":7830,""binwts_q_norm"":7005,""binatts_q_comp1"":23075,""binatts_q_comp2"":9262,""binatts_q_real"":7402,""binatts_q_norm"":5546,""lex_q_comp1"":5567,""lex_q_comp2"":8089,""lex_q_real"":6029,""lex_q_norm"":2827,""consistency1"":11709,""consistency2"":8857,""appropriateness"":15161,""strategy2"":92349,""confidence"":8918,""metastrategy"":239254,""attention"":5953,""choice_domain"":3760,""choice_exp"":7274,""icar"":520057}",I will complete this study with my full attention.,Woman,,"[""White"",""Hispanic, Latinx, or Spanish origin""]",High school,"$5,000 - $10,000",Yes,"Yes, I am okay with my answers to these questions ","",,,,"[4166,3060,8471,10527,11448,18455,29878,9791,21025,22661,72928,2900,13306,11900,5054,2774,6938,10191,2939,3511,24287,8476,15332,4040,10094,4034,2910,28869,3682,10727,3013,2095,1986,15439,11051,1343,7372,5265,9884,9166,4385,6314,1559,4560,1046]","features,weights","binwts,binatts,lex","ew,wad,lex",187,187,6155b9c45f96867d9d9631fd,297,ma_choice_v4_movies_real1,3969815,2022-11-17 19:34:07,3739

When that total was within 1, a positive Romantic Scene/Humor weighting would tip the decision even if a movie scored worse in Bad/Very Bad. What's more, a very strong Romantic Scenes/Humor weighting could overcome a larger difference in the Bad/Very Bad comparison. 

When elements were all very close, the Acting category carried enough weight to tip the decision.

(Now, I REALLY hope you reveal what criteria they actually used.)","I noted the differences in the categories after learning which movie was chosen. Early on, I noticed the Bad/Very Bad designations having a clear impact but also noticed outliers. Over several selections, I tried to narrow down commonalities among the outliers and narrowed it to Acting, Humor and Romantic Scenes. I thought Humor was the main criteria until more outliers showed up, which lead me to observe how Romantic Scenes was affecting the decision. Eventually that appeared to have greater influence than Humor, but both remained dominant factors.",75,87,,75,100,0,66,Yes,Less than 1 year,0,0,No,I am relatively new to mindfulness meditation.,,,,,,,"{""VR.4"":""5"",""VR.16"":""It is impossible to tell"",""VR.17"":""47"",""VR.19"":""Sunday"",""LN.7"":""X"",""LN.33"":""G"",""LN.34"":""X"",""LN.58"":""N"",""MX.45"":""E"",""MX.46"":""B"",""MX.47"":""B"",""MX.55"":""D"",""R3D.3"":""C"",""R3D.4"":""G"",""R3D.6"":""F"",""R3D.8"":""G""}","[""LN.7"",""LN.33"",""LN.34"",""LN.58"",""MX.45"",""MX.46"",""MX.47"",""MX.55"",""R3D.3"",""R3D.6"",""R3D.8"",""VR.4"",""VR.16"",""VR.17"",""VR.19""]",15,nope (gulp),Yes,,"{""strategy"":364959,""lex_q_comp1"":27932,""lex_q_comp2"":9583,""lex_q_real"":19663,""lex_q_norm"":12283,""binwts_q_comp1"":18235,""binwts_q_comp2"":7715,""binwts_q_real"":19438,""binwts_q_norm"":15635,""binatts_q_comp1"":16378,""binatts_q_comp2"":15984,""binatts_q_real"":13172,""binatts_q_norm"":12520,""consistency1"":10922,""consistency2"":16412,""appropriateness"":14230,""strategy2"":394143,""confidence"":26560,""metastrategy"":244648,""attention"":5263,""choice_domain"":5533,""choice_exp"":4690,""icar"":754829}",I will complete this study with my full attention.,Man,,"[""White""]",4 year degree,"Over $100,000",Yes,"Yes, I am okay with my answers to these questions ","This was fun and I'm glad I spent the time on it.

Sometimes the answers were obvious because one movie was objectively better than the other. However, on movies that seemed to be more balanced, I could tell that certain features in the movies appealed to the user more, like acting, dialogue, romance, and the soundtrack. I picked up on these features and could eventually correctly guess which option they would choose. In Section 2, I learned about the different strategies people could take in determining the better movie. After reading about the different strategies, I could pinpoint the strategy the user made based on my previous experience in Section 1.

This last section did not make sense to me.  I clicked the same on all of them, not because I was rushing through, but because I did not see some of these as central at all to the users cares when choosing a movie.  For the user, I believe that acting was definitely first in their considerations, followed by dialogue and plot.  So things like visuals or romantic scenes were not really a factor for them, and a movie would not be chosen based on those categories.","It waspretty consistent that the user favored acting, dialogue and plot.

The user seemed to be somewhat of a harsh critic. They judged each subject as to how they felt about the movie.  The plot of the movie, the expertise of the actors and how the production of the movie went were determined either very good or very bad.  
When we watch a movie, the interest peaks quickly and we expect it to continue.  How or why it continues as it does brings much criticism for those of us who have little or no knowledge of the hows and whys of movies. "," 
 The Prolific user was able to judge each and every subject mentioned.  The choices depended on their various tastes. This one seemed a bit reluctant to choose the best for most of the questions about their movies.
Being able to determine the many different reasons these choices were made seems a bit presumptuous.
I'm not able to able govern the feelings that went into each of these judgments, but it seemed a bit on the rather severe determinations of the Prolific user. 
This user seemed to hone in on the romantic and plots of the stories. 
This is the only way I am able to ""see"" this user's choices here.", I feel their choices came from the background of the user.  Being raised in a home where movies were seen often might have made a difference. This user seemed a bit strict as to what was expected in each choice.

At first i thought they were picking the worst in the the case of two bad choices but that didn't work, then for a bit it seemed they favored acting and dialogue when the choice was unclear, but even that failed after a few choices. ","Again, like i stated earlier, when i guessed along 75-80% of the time the choices were easy, it's the odd 20% that still confuse me. I looked for priorities and did not see any.

It may have been useful to see your methods before the 100 descriptions as that may have impacted my viewing",I didn't. I looked for patterns in the 20 of so choices that i found odd and could not get any to work. I thought i saw i trend towards acting so went with that but it failed after a couple picks.
