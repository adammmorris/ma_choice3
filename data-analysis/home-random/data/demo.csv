Positive anchors:
-A good kitchen (I love cooking) was one of the main things in favor of a house. However, if everything was good except a house's kitchen, I figured I'd rather accept a bad kitchen and renovate it later. After all, you can't renovate noise pollution or traffic away.
-AC was nice, but I wouldn't always pick based on it; I've lived in places with bad AC and it was fine once you get used to it.

Negative anchors:
-Traffic is the worst. I could occasionally accept high traffic, especially if the kitchen was great and the house was alright. But I generally hate driving in traffic.
-Noise pollution, I imagine I could get used to it, but I generally tried to avoid it.

Tie-breaker:
-House size/square footage also helped me decide when things were tough.

We do a lot of cooking at home and also have a fair amount of allergies between the two of us, so kitchen and HVAC conditions were weighed secondly and in an even manner. If both were in ""very bad"" condition it was, in combination with some other factors, enough to sway me in the direction of the other home. 
Factors such as house age and access to good schools were a non-decision influencer for me. We don't have children and never plan to so that isn't something we would be concerned with.

I ALWAYS chose the house with the better school. After all, if I can only afford to rent, I obviously cannot afford private school.  Ideally, this would coincide with very little to a little traffic, but when these conflicted, school quality won out.The distance from parks was important, but the descriptions did not disclose whether the ""distance"" (which was really ""time"") reflected walking or driving time. I assumed that in the U.S., where most people prefer car travel to travel on foot, the time reflected car travel. In this case, the differential was mainly irrelevant (even for a teenager, a 5 mile jog is a bit much before playing a soccer or baseball game, after all). In real life, I would not choose a house with a lot of traffic and without proximity to parks, as these are key quality of life measures for my family. With children, all three factors are important.  If I were buying rather than renting, I'd be concerned with the age of the house (i.e., prior to 1970 means more solid construction), the state of the HVAC system, and the quality of the kitchen. However, structural matters are my landlord's problem rather than mine if I am a renter (this was a tough mindset as I was initially distracted by these issues).  The house size does not matter, although I prefer smaller to keep utility costs and environmental footprint smaller.  ","Yes, I realized that below a certain size, a house would be too small, i.e., belwo 1200 sf is small for 3+ people.","I was pretty clear that my strategy focused primarily on school quality.

It wasn't really explained what it meant as in quality but from a rental standpoint, you have an easier time getting landlords to fix kitchen and other issues vs ac/heat. So my way of thinking is that size doesn't matter, school and noise don't matter because there are ways of limiting the noise you hear outside and homeschooling is always an option, but ac/heat first and kitchen second.

That being said, a large lawn did seem to able to make up for a small house, but only in very limited circumstances where the difference between the size of the two houses was not THAT much (but still enough for one to be, say, miniscule and the other only, say, small), and the house with the bigger lawn was also better on other dimensions as well.

Distance to parks was completely irrelevent.

Noise pollution probably also in the end never made any sort of decisive difference in anything, though I did like to consider it along with the amount of traffic to determine just a sort of general level of seclusion for a house, with a more secluded house being better, and though this factor of seclusion was important, it seemed to be basically completely dominated by traffic with noise pollution not really mattering.

The kitchen wasn't terribly important because I'm not all that concerned with cooking gormuet meals. As long as its quality was at least bad, it was good enough, though a very bad kitchen might be cause to consider the other house further, and the kitchen did have minor sway if it ever came down to no one particular aspect of either house on its own was enough to be decisive, and we had to weigh the sum of all the parts together.

The AC was a fairly important factor that could often override other lessor factors like the kitchen or the size of the house if the difference wasn't that great (Speaking of which, basically once a house hit around 1300 square feet, bigger wasn't really better so an 1800 square foot house and a 1300 square foot house where the 1300 square foot house had even a minor aspect better like the kitchen being just very good instead of good might very well lead me to choose the 1300 square foot house). That","Well, answering more along the lines of the strategies presented, In general, though the size of the house did tend to dominate other factors, it was not the exclusive factor and other things could matter in various circumstances, and I most definitely cared about different factors different amounts and they weren't all just the same, and admitedly I didn't entirely consider the amounts the various factors were better in one house over another and to some extent it could sort of simply be that this house was good on that factor and the other house was bad, but it still wasn't absolutely and completely just ""This house wins and that's all there is to it"", but if the factors were close in multiple different areas then it could be time to weigh everything together as a whole and not worry about individual things too much, which means in such a case each factor would contribute a certain value to how good the house feels to me that would indeed vary based on the total quality and not just if it's good enough, so I was sort of mixed in that regard, I suppose.

Overall, though, it's not like it isn't still true that the kitchen hardly mattered and things like that.","You asked me to pay attention to my process when I was making the decisions, so after deciding on a house I would very often stop and think, ""Okay, why did I make this choice and what does it mean?"" and the answer would tend to be something along the lines of ""Hmm... it would appear that though I would really like a secluded house, I'm not willing to give up the quality of the school, the air conditioning AND the kitchen just for that"", so I was specifically keeping track on what mattered and what didn't and what things were more important than what, and admitedly I couldn't really remember a lot of the tiny tiny details of it like when EXACTLY is such and such a combination better and not just the vague idea of it, but overall I probably remembered all the really big stuff",96,91,,25,91,1-5,1,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{""strategy"":1935229,""binwts_q_comp1"":38021,""binwts_q_comp2"":23603,""binwts_q_real"":14873,""binwts_q_norm"":11187,""binatts_q_comp1"":27694,""binatts_q_comp2"":28408,""binatts_q_real"":23486,""binatts_q_norm"":19633,""lex_q_comp1"":19023,""lex_q_comp2"":16130,""lex_q_real"":23461,""lex_q_norm"":14534,""consistency1"":35209,""consistency2"":26627,""appropriateness"":66970,""strategy2"":510370,""confidence"":25451,""satisfaction"":10484,""metastrategy"":282041,""attention"":21567,""choice_domain"":14921,""choice_exp"":17007}",I will complete this study with my full attention.,Man,25,"[""Black or African American""]",High school,"Under $5,000",Yes,"Yes, I am okay with my answers to these questions ","I mean, it took me way longer than it said it would, but that's normal, and I just tend to take about twice as long to do just any study as most people do.

After that was size.  Anything under 1000 was very difficult to accept.  Anything above was a bonus.

If after that there wasn't a clear winner, I took in the other options based on how difficult it was to deal with negatives.  Yard size is hard to replace if you don't have any as is the Kitchen.

A kitchen especially in a rental is not that important. A little elbow grease, some cleaning supplies and making sure the necessary basic appliances are there is all that matters. The HVAC/AC system is also important and it is protected in a rental by local laws. A landlord has to provide heating and cooling in a sufficient manner that will maintain the comfort and safety of the tenant. If the landlord doesn't maintain the equipment then I can involve the local agencies to get it repaired and in working order. The other features are nice to have, size of yard, size of house, low noise and traffic are all wonderful to look for if I were buying. Renting, although it will be my home, will not really be a permanent home so those features factored in but not as much as the first two.  ",My strategy stayed the same. I am renting not buying.

However, I felt a home had to be at least 1000 square feet, so if noise was low but the home was very small--and some were ridiculously so--I went for the larger home.  I did, however, choose, say, a 1200 square foot home over a 1600 if the larger home sounded like it was in a noisy neighborhood.

School quality didn't factor for me (no kids). I was indifferent to the size of the yard since I'm no gardener. While a poor kitchen and a bad heat/AC system were turn-offs, I figured I could easily upgrade them whereas I couldn't fix noise and adding square footage would be too expensive and only feasible with larger property size.  I also didn't give much importance to the year of construction. 

I felt a key factor was missing: location location location. Nearness of parks didn't mean much to me but amenities and convenience and the quality of the neighborhood would have.","No, I was fairly certain of my preferences all along.

I do not have children so at first I figured that this had no value to me,  but as I was going along I realized that this is a great indicator of crime in the area and the quality of local government. It would also factor largely into the resale-ability of the home.  So then my order of choosing went to noise pollution-reputation of school-square footage.

The reason for this is that the men in my family for 5 generations worked in HVAC and I know very well how much it can cost to fix problems with this stuff, and as a single woman on a very low income due to job loss I am well aware of what things cost. I also know that if this stuff is inefficient, even that can make for huge bills. I also really am picky about how hot or cold it is in the house at different times of year. So that was my main criteria for choice. If it has a bad HVAC system your life would be miserable. You can't escape it or it costs a fortune to repair. If that was nearly equal, I often chose based on noise pollution as I like things quiet. Some of the other criteria, like the age of the house, I didn't care about at all so I ignored those factors. Same with schools--I don't have kids so whatever the school quality was didn't matter to me. ","Since you had said ""all else was equal"" then it removed my preference for how I made the choice in every instance but for one and so I had to judge by new criteria. So like, you have had us make choices on our tier 2 or 3 or 4 or even lower basis for judgment. In each of those cases I had a clear preference but for the year one where I seemed to prefer the oldest house and skipped houses in a certain time frame, and then preferred much newer. ","Um, I don't understand this question. It seems circular in reasoning? I knew my method for making choices from the sample questions onward in part one. Like as soon as I saw a criteria that mattered most and one that was secondary to it, I used that through all 100 trials. Then in part 2 I used it again except in ones where those things were equal and then I chose based on other criteria but like, the same method. I always used the same choice method through section one and two. I know what my section one choice process was because I chose it in the sample part. I don't know if that answers your question. I would know it by the time I got to section2 because I'd already used it.

Noise pollution would be nice if it wasn't always loud outside, a nice school nearby means it would hopefully be in a decent neighborhood, and I like to cook so a decent kitchen would be nice. Then, I looked at traffic which played a small role since I don't drive often. The size of the home was irrelevant because I'm single and don't have many things. The year it was built was irrelevant because older homes can be fixed up and made nicer. Closeness to parks was irrelevant because I don't go on walks or anything like that. That's about it I think.

Yard is important, but a ginormous house is also nice, but not necessary. 

As someone who will never have children, the school situation carried no importance. 

The kitchen and air conditioning were also unimportant, because I could upgrade them if they were in disrepair. 

I like old houses, so that wasn't relevant. Newer houses also don't bother me.

I will never set foot in a 'Park' so no consideration there, either.

Mostly, I just want it peaceful and quiet. I want to set my cats free outside and not have to worry about traffic. I don't REALLY care about how big the house is, but I would like a yard I can work with.

That's about it.","Nothing has changed, although I would add that I did look at the yard vs house size and decide based on ""how much bigger"" and 'how much total footage between the yard and the house' instead of in a ""win or lose"" frame of mind. Sometimes I just didn't want a super tiny 'nothing' yard and ignored the house size. 

But other than that, I mainly just focused on noise and traffic and only looked at the house and yard size when noise + traffic seemed equally off putting for both houses.

One aspect that was not covered was closeness to public transportation or grocery stores.  Those might have impacted my decisions since neither of us drive and do not have a vehicle.  This led to me not taking traffic into account much.

We do not have children, so the parks or school reputation weren't priorities.  However, school reputation can have impacts outside of just those who attend it.
