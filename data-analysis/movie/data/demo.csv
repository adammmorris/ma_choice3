When the general balance of ratings was somewhat even between the two, then I made a lot of judgement calls, where humor was more important than romance, and I think I tended to pick dialogue over visuals.

Also, since we are talking about the movie trailer, it changes the equation a bit, as great acting doesn't show through as much, whereas humor is almost always front and center in the trailer.","I would say my description has stayed mostly the same.  I decided based on multiple factors of differing importance, and mostly chose the movie that was ""better"" along those lines.  The exception was when the choice was between something ok, but not exceptionally good, and something absolutely terrible.  Then, I picked the bad one.   Overall, I looked for what would come across best in a movie trailer.","I couldn't help but think of my section 1 process as I was doing section 1.  Especially on the early trials, I wasn't just making decisions about that trial, I was establishing for myself how I was going to proceed.

Then I would compare the two films by the high points and low points, keeping in mind that a specific category may just be one scene.
Certain categories garnered more weight than others and I have those in tiers
1. Plot, Dialog, and whatever categories gained the highest possible marker for that movie. These hold a lot of weight to my decision making to determine the quality of a movie, be it documentary, action, etc...
2. Humor, Action, Romance. I will often find whichever are combined in the most favorable order. most commonly there are 2 but rarely 3.
3. other categories are considered, but only if all other things are equal

Some of my decision making is based on how much I will enjoy watching the film, but sometimes my choices will be made by incredibly high scores for multiple categories (denoting a potential must see) or incredibly low scores for multiple categories (it's so bad its good and no matter what I will enjoy how bad it is and telling people how much I hate it). 
","My strategy has not changed at all. I will maintain my tiered structure. Depending how my choices resulted in my viewing experiences then I might make some adjustments. Currently, my beginning strategy is sound.","When faced with an option between two things I will often default to breaking it down by characteristics and determine my choice based on what I think my experience will be like. The selection was already set up in a grid pattern and labeled. I followed what was given and quickly knew my tiers would be based on importance to the film. Plot and dialog weigh the most simply because they affect a story more than anything. However lower scores for plot and dialog can be outweighed by multiple high marks for Action, Humor, Romance.

I'd consider how the different strengths of each movie combined and whether that combination what appealing or not to me. I typically didn't look at what the movies were very bad at because some movies aren't trying to hit every base. If the combination of good and very good ratings was something I would like, such as Romantic and Humorous, that would trump a mediocre across the board movie. If both movies were average, I would typically go with the one that had better ratings overall. In terms of the individual ratings, I tended to put more weight on the plot, humor, action, dialogue and romance. Personally, having great visuals doesn't make up for an otherwise poor movie, but something like humor would. Some of the rating I struggled differentiating between, such as creativity and plot, as I feel like the two are really closely related. ","No; like I said before, I tended to look at the strengths of each movie and from there see which combination I preferred to use.

I know how it's going to end in the first 5 or 10 minutes but I still enjoy going on the journey with them. If it IS an action movie, then I like it OK, but I can definitely do without a lot of flash and bang.","I just tried to weigh them all together. Again, I focused primarily on acting, dialogue, and plot, but also looked at the humor and romance.  Not knowing the genre, it is hard to tell if they would be appropriate. Example, a movie about a war would probably have a lot of action and very little romance or humor, but it would still be a good movie. A rom-com would have lots of humor and romance but little to no action scenes and still be a good movie.  That is why the plot and dialogue and acting are so important. They can make an old, many times told tale still seem interesting and something you want to see.","I think  I remembered. I don't know what I am supposed to say here, guys.

2nd, I looked for any movies with VERY BAD ratings. The more VERY BAD ratings, the least likely I would pick that movie.
VERY BAD movies are barely watchable.

3rd, any movies with similar VERY GOOD and VERY BAD ratings,  I looked at genre.  I love VISUALS so I picked any movie that had GOOD, or at least MODERATE, visuals. Next came ACTING and PLOT, picked the same way.  

I really am not a fan of ROMANCE so I picked that movie last,  if it did not have a VERY GOOD review.

2nd I look to VERY BAD REVIEWS, and I do not pick those movies.

3rd I look for movies with GOOD, or MODERATE, VISUALS.  I pick those next.

Then I look for GOOD ACTING.

I picked ROMANCE last because it is my least favorite.

This is the same routine as before.

","I picked my Section 1 choices almost like I pick my movies in real life.

If I read a review that has a VERY GOOD rating, on any aspects, I pick that movie first.

I couldn't care less about romantic scenes. I do not really consider a lot of the other factors all that important either and that includes soundtrack. Action scenes I can go either way on since I think they are more important in some movies and may not matter at all in others. In some cases where it was really difficult to decide due to the factors I care about being pretty equal, I would consider the entirety of the ratings. In other words, if one movie had a lot more ""very bad"" ratings I would tend to select the other one. Sometimes the answers were very obvious since there were a few movies that had almost all ""very bad"" ratings and that made the selection very easy.","No, my strategy is exactly the same and has not changed at all but I am reminded of some of the other factors. I still consider acting and plot to be my main deciding factors. Action scenes would depend on what kind of movie it is since the importance of that would differ based on that. To an extent, the humor would matter to me only if that was what I expected from the movie. If I did not expect it to be funny, I would not care much. I care nothing about romantic scenes and I do not care a lot about creativity, sound track and visuals. For the factors I do not care much about, it makes a HUGE difference what kind of movie it is. In other words if it was an action move, I would expect the action scenes to be a lot more important. The same is largely true where dialog is concerned. It may not matter much in an action movie but for a movie that is about personal relationships it would matter.

This seems very detatched from the experience of watching movies. What does an action scene category even mean for a movie without action scenes?! But it's given the same weight as everything else. It's dumb, I'm telling you.

With randomizing the order of the elements, it's like you went out of your way to make the survey as difficult to take and brain draining as possible. This is really difficult to focus on.

Isn't this just training the user to associate full bars with good movies? The use of color was also inappropriate, the blue bars looks intrinsically more appealing than the gray ones.

I tried to be consistent in my choices (knowing I'd be asked of course to defend or explain them)
I love humor of any type, I deplore humor that takes advantage of one sector of society or race or culture and makes it into a caricature of itself.  For example the Italian person who is always saying words with ""-a"" at the end, that is NOT good attempt of humor for me.  So given the short time for doing this, I picked the factor of ""humor"" to be first on my lengthy list of wants in a movie choice.  No matter how bad the other factors are (and I'll see how much I can write here to explain further), I can sit through just about any movie that makes me really laugh and I can remember and take back home with me some of the jokes that have never been told before.  Same goes for other very technical items, like action scenes, acting, plot, dialog, visuals, soundtrack.  If they are ""decent"" and not bad or very bad, overall I'd pick that film even if humor was not the highest ranking compared to other film as long as humor is NOT bad or very bad, I'll take it.
Finally, I saved (not intentionally but your visual listing made it easy to compare these items) I would look last a ""romantic"" qualities and if the others were a close tie, I'd use solely (not humor or others) Romantic Scenes as the tiebreaker for my judgement.
Thus I tried from the practice ones to learn what I should do in the real ones so my first choices, films choices #1 and onward, were exactly perfectly done all the way to 100.
I have always been numerologist, so I really tried not to notice the ""number"" of the film choice grouping and for those that want to keep track of progress, that was a welcome addition---not every survey does that! Thank you!
So I didn't or tried not to hold it against any choices...
As a famous movie quote stated and I would have loved to hav","I think you explained the various strategies from A through F very clearly.  I still did and maintain that I made my choices as a professional in my chosen profession would, equally evaluating every possible angle, and coming up with something that both pleased my thinking side and my creative side as well.  I allow for spontaneity in movies, if someone comes up with a new idea or concept in any of those areas  (i.e. casting as actor the person in Captain Phillips from that area who appeared to be a Pirate for real, because that is how they all appeared and aged over their lives, not something you can just put makeup or acting school upon them (first example I could think of here there are more I'm certain if I had a moment more)...
My thinking is that you have expressed in words (and images) what I was doing inside my mind, trying to be consistent from the moment I did the 10 practice samples to get rolling and into the process, so that my first actual choices I felt were done just as well as my 100th choice...without falling into a trap of repetitive actions over and over, I tried to take a breath every 5 or 10 even numbers just to slow me down and make certain I was not just knee-jerk responses but actually (like you promised) I'd have to choose a R rated trailer soon to actually view.","Unfortunately, as I stated earlier, I am a professional in that area of making judgements about movies (former active member of AMPAS) and who actually voted on these factors among hundreds of others for hundreds of movies.  So I developed my own feeling and concept of how I'd handle this and just used it here as it was most naturally mine....I used humor basically as a ""shortcut"" as I don't have unlimited time here but otherwise I stuck to my concept of allowing many factors you presented to judge a movie for the most part, with ""romantic scenes"" becoming my tiebreaker for this study alone.
I think I revealed I had a pen and paper here and took a few notes along the 100 choices if I thought of something I might say in a text box later on, so that helped me to recall my thoughts as I was doing them.",96,81,,76,100,15-Oct,6,Yes,More than 5 years,16,6,No,I have a moderate amount of experience with mindfulness meditation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{""strategy"":1619714,""consistency2"":25893,""lex_q_comp1"":44962,""lex_q_comp2"":31594,""lex_q_real"":61752,""lex_q_norm"":36431,""binatts_q_comp1"":63203,""binatts_q_comp2"":29252,""binatts_q_real"":20541,""binatts_q_norm"":28549,""binwts_q_comp1"":33343,""binwts_q_comp2"":27064,""binwts_q_real"":29805,""binwts_q_norm"":26447,""consistency1"":35832,""appropriateness"":28976,""strategy2"":450083,""confidence"":17213,""satisfaction"":44110,""metastrategy"":256445,""attention"":16173,""choice_domain"":23111,""choice_exp"":15760,""display_trailer"":152634}",I will complete this study with my full attention.,Man,64,"[""White""]",Postgraduate/Professional degree/other,"$5,000 - $10,000",Yes,"Yes, I am okay with my answers to these questions ","No problems!

OK. You asked.

He succeeds although there is comedic pushback as she clings to her waistral autonomy and in the end, they both ""win"" and fall in love (yuck! - she is so beautiful and he is so old and bossy!) because she succeeds in ""becoming a lady"" (impersonator) after much singing and dancing and lessons in erudition as well as basic grammar.

It felt more like Poker: certain combinations that worked well together.

The 'standard' would be Plot + Dialogue + Acting with a non horrible in one of Action/Humor/Romantic/Creative.  The three suggests that no matter the movie it will be made well.  So those three were the most important.  

However certain ""Very Good/Good"" aspects would mean others can be sacrificed.  For example:

Very Good/Good Action Scenes might be good enough to watch on its own.  Kung Fu movies could have a bad Plot/Acting/Dialogue/Romance so long as the Visuals and Soundtrack were not horrible.  

Very Good Humor needs good Acting and not horrible Dialogue but almost everything else could be sacrificed, though more good aspects do help.

Good Romance Scenes still needs good Acting and Dialogue but doesn't need anything else.

Creativity can't go on it's own but acts like a Wild Card and allows for more forgiveness overall.  So, say, a movie with Good Acting but bad Plot can still be ok with a lot of Creativity.  Worth a try at least.  A bad movie with Very Good Creativity is an option if the other movie isn't already winning somehow.

Soundtrack/visuals were bonus.  They can help break ties or overall make a movie look better but can't save a bad movie.   

As far as making the choices itself, if one movie had a lot of Goods or a lot of Bads then I would focus on that to see if it made any good combinations. It was possible for a movie with mostly Very Bads to have a few Good key spots that would suggest it's Very Good at a specific theme, which is what you really want from aa movie.  In converse, a movie with Very Good everything but Acting and Plot and didn't have a VERY GOOD in Action means it's not that great of a movie, but would still win out against a fully Very bad movie.

","I very much described my strategy properly in the first question. If anything, the following questions don't really paint a proper picture of my strategy. For example, Plot was the first thing I checked on the movie and was important, but if a movie had Very Good Action or Humor or Romance then it could sacrifice Plot.  So a movie with Very Good Plot and Moderate everything else may lose to a movie with Very Bad Plot, Very Good Acting, and Very Good Action Scenes.  

The strategy was complex but consistently used.","After doing a few choices I analyzed WHY i would make those choices, then after analyzing them, tested them on the next few choices. That is, I noticed which choices seemed more appealing,  guessed why I would make them, then tested the theory on the next few choices. Then reevaluated until I had a strategy that would consistently match the choices I wanted to make.

It resulted in a rather messy explanation, but it was my reasoning.",80,94,,95,100,15-Oct,67,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{""strategy"":689842,""binwts_q_comp1"":9472,""binwts_q_comp2"":4914,""binwts_q_real"":4644,""binwts_q_norm"":4501,""binatts_q_comp1"":12298,""binatts_q_comp2"":13080,""binatts_q_real"":6987,""binatts_q_norm"":7322,""lex_q_comp1"":10137,""lex_q_comp2"":6829,""lex_q_real"":2697,""lex_q_norm"":2214,""consistency1"":13237,""consistency2"":11413,""appropriateness"":29651,""strategy2"":208790,""confidence"":6656,""satisfaction"":3333,""metastrategy"":126333,""attention"":3986,""choice_domain"":6926,""choice_exp"":5395,""display_trailer"":34984}",I will complete this study with my full attention.,Man,42,"[""Black or African American""]",Some college,"$50,000 - $65,000",Yes,"Yes, I am okay with my answers to these questions ",Not sure if it mattered but I was able to describe the plot because I had seen it before.

However, on closer inspection, I based my thoughts primarily on acting, plot, dialogue, and humor, though not necessarily in that order. But it was more important than some other qualities like soundtrack. I was also thinking about the type of movie I'd be seeing as well, in terms of comedy/drama/romance, in relation to the levels of the options. If it was likely an action movie, humor and dialogue didn't matter as much. If it seemed like it was going to be a drama, the visuals didn't matter as much. So I created a schema of the movie genre and then prioritized some dimensions over others when thinking about that. Other times, though, it was just whichever had the most of everything. Also, sometimes it was the amount of the difference between dimensions. Bad-moderate isn't as big of a consideration as good-bad or very good-moderate.

I was somewhat inconsistent in this, and it was often difficult to choose.  Romance is only important in romance movies, but it is irrelevant if the main four are not there.  The same goes for Action, Visuals, Soundtrack, Humor and so on.

With his powerful driving skills and foulmouthed attitude, Happy becomes an unlikely golf hero -- much to the chagrin of the well-mannered golf professionals.","[2737,4386,2404,7396,3054,20477,6167,8894,15322,9498,2264,16860,4145,2784,5463,1637,5812,12880,2483.6999999955297,2755.5,41047,4797.10000000149,39989.39999999851,7147,4066.39999999851,33059.19999999553,36718.5,3113.3000000044703,25971.10000000149,10540.89999999851,9627,33153.60000000149,5023,18426.10000000149,38902,2025,3418,3214,14553,14049,3973,2959,1618,1764,709,2415]","features,weights","binatts,binwts,lex","lex,wad,ew",,,,,,3158510,6/29/22 16:23,3229

I thought this would be the most logical place to start. Then about 10 trials in, I realized that there are movies I've loved in the past that have ""bad"" acting, but which are fantastic in their own right. So then I started judging based on ""plot"". Then about 10 trials later, I realized there are movies that have ""bad"" acting and plots, but which are potentially very funny. So I started preferring movies that I thought would have great humor. Predictably, I jumped from that measure, to judging based on how visually stunning or action-filled a movie was. I later went through a ""romantic"" phase where I felt like watching movies that were focused on that aspect. Finally, throughout the last 30-40 or so judgements, I actually relied much less heavily on individual elements, and more so on wholistic measures of each set of movies shown. If I saw generally moderate to good reviews on several important key aspects, I usually rated that movie higher than the other. However, if I noticed that a movie had a ""very good"" rating on one of several key aspects (in particular humor, visuals, plot, creativity, dialogue, action, or acting), even despite that movie maybe being subpar or terrible in most other aspects, I usually chose the movie that had a stellar rating in limited aspects. This is because there have been movies in the past I've watched that I watched simply due to that one key aspect. I watched those movies despite other aspects ""dragging"" it's weighting down. In my mind, movies are almost like moods. Sometimes I want pure action. Other times I want romantic comedy.
