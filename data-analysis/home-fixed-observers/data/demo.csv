Also in general, if there were 2-3 ""very bad"" or 3+ ""bad"" ratings, they would pick the other house regardless of category.

A significant amount of time they tended to select the bigger house. 

However, how much negatives there were to positive traits also influenced their decision. For instance, if a house carried a lot more ""bad"" and ""very bad"" qualities, the Prolific user would tend to choose the option with better qualities, but only if the size of the house was not sacrificed (give or take 300-400 sq ft avg). If both house options had an equal number of bad traits, the Prolific user would choose the bigger house. Additionally, if the size of a house was bigger by >600 sq ft, the user would choose that bigger house option regardless of whether there were many cons to pros.

Reputation of the schools and park distance did not matter at all to this user.

Overall, I believe the Prolific user first determined how big the houses were, then how many ""bad"" and ""very bad"" qualities were listed, and assessed whether those bad qualities were numerous enough to sway a decision. If the bad qualities were relatively the same amount, or the house size difference was significant, the user would almost always choose the bigger house.

","My description has not really changed, but I think the strategies and questions this study provides does not fully describe the user's strategy. 

I would describe it as the Prolific user having the single most deciding factor, which is house size, and then comparing the rest of the traits if the size difference is worth bearing the number of negatives. The rest of the other traits' description would not significantly matter, as the kitchen could be very bad quality or the AC/heating unit could be bad etc. 

For example, if a moderately larger house had two ""bad"" qualities vs a smaller house with one ""bad"" quality, the Prolific user would choose the larger house. 

However, if a moderately larger house had a majority bad qualities vs a smaller house, the Prolific user would choose the smaller house.

An exception is when the house is significantly larger, such as by over 600 sq ft, that regardless of a majority of bad qualities the user would choose the larger house.","I knew there was one single trait the Prolific user valued the most, which is house size.

They preferred low to moderate noise environments. They did not care about the reputation of the school, so it is safe to assume they did not have children. Also, either they did not cook or they were planning on gutting the kitchen because that was low on their list of priorities. Though at times, they seemed to be willing to sacrifice on the noise level if the kitchen and HVAC units were in good shape. The closeness to the park did not seem to matter. Occasionally, I felt they chose the low traffic area, though again that did not seem to be a deciding factor. The size of the yard was not pertinent either. Their decision seemed to mainly rely on noise level with amenities (such as hvac and kitchen size being a close second)","Actually yes, I originally thought in terms of what the user wanted (low noise level) but I also see it from what they didn't want: good schools, close to parks. My conclusion from this part would be the user does not like children and finds them noisy. As noise is the user's most imperative desire - having children nearby would ruin their peace. ","I watched the studies to see what I thought the user would choose based on the previous qualifications. There were times I did not understand their choice, but I was looking at the positives for being positives and never looking at the negatives (bad schools) ss being positives as well.

The general strategy looked like get the quietest house, and then with the best traffic and a reasonable distance to a park, but sometimes it seemed like the renter wanted to maximize those three areas, so if there was a bad noise rating, they might choose that house anyway if the other two qualities were clearly much better. 

I couldn't find much pattern in choices when it came to school quality, size of house and yard, age of house, quality of kitchen and HVAC. Those all seemed lower priority, if they mattered at all, when compared to the noise rating, and then the traffic and parks. The only thing I noticed was the renter seemed to go against all of their preferences if one of the two houses appeared much better in a lot of the categories.

There were a few instances that were outliers, that went against the priority categories and didn't seem to offer much better choices in the other house, but it was chosen anyway.

It also seemed like the year it was built and school reputation was also important, but there were many times when it did not seem like it mattered. 

They will generally always choose the property with the biggest space unless the two homes were close in size. If the sizes of the two homes were only a difference of say 200-400 square feet, they would look at kitchen quality next and make their choice. I also noticed that if the square foot was below 800, they ignored it completely, which made me assume that's their baseline as to how big they want their home. I came to that conclusion because there were a few times they chose the biggest house but had the worst specs in every category, which told me they valued size over everything. 

The things they cared about the least were the park distance, noise level, traffic, yard, and AC/Heating. However, it did come into play when the home size and kitchen were very similar in specs. Other than that, I was able to guess with a 95% accuracy on what the user was going to pick next based on the home size and kitchen quality. ","My description has not changed one bit, in fact, it actually felt validated after reading the following materials on the different strategies. The user definitely applied one of those strategies in their decision making and it totally makes sense. I still believe they chose home size and kitchen quality as their two biggest specs they were looking for. ","I can't say I know what the user's process was 100%, but I have a pretty good guess as to what they were choosing, because it was a obvious pattern. I actually covered up the answers for each test and made a guess of my own based on the pattern I saw.

Home size - between 600 and 1800, slightly weighted towards the higher number
Yard size - between 50 and 500
But prefered home size 3x the yard size or greater.

I did not see significant preference expressed on other items like school quality, kitchens, and etc.

","My perception is that the person had three variables they considered: home size, yard size, home age. 
I think the person preferred the biggest home that came with a non-zero sized yard, but not necesarily the largest 600 sq.ft. yard.  And as a very weak preference, I think the person newer to older homes.  
There seemed no preference for the other variables.  

In summary, my opinion has not changed, except so as to add a weak preference for newer rather than older.  But the frameworks given did help, and I think the strategy used is best described by the last one presented to me, which I believe was framework ""F"".","I made a best guess. The respondent's answers did not seem completely consistent.  I simplified by looking at just the two variables that seemed most correlated to me in what the person was doing.  This led to simpler projections for me of what was steering the person's choices.  But I recognize they may have been valuing more variables than what I was baselining off of, and the tradeoffs there were too subtle for me to discern. 
To summarize, I looked for what seemed the most relevant variables to their choices and baselined what I thought they were doing off of that.  This was perhaps a simplification for me... which may not have grasped their opinions of less dominant variables driving their choices.
