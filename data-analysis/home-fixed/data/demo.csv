I can work around other shortcomings but a must is a good heat and ac source. The kitchen is considered the heart of the home but as a single person who does not cook to much I can figure out how to make do with a less than ideal cooking space.  I have no kids so the schools are not important but they can be a sign of what the neighborhood is like.  The size of the home has some importance but I can make do with a smaller space.  I would prefer a quiet space but to enjoy but if the heat/ac does not work than I will be doubly annoyed.  I can drive to parks if I desire so having one close by is not a must.,"My strategy has not changed.  Given that there are only two options, house A and B, I opted to place much higher value on the heat/as and kitchen if possible. The size of home was not too important as I am single and live alone.  The extra space would not sway me.  The distance to a park is not a big deal either way.  In a perfect setting quiet and less traffic would be wanted but that did not always mesh with the quality of the heat/ac and the kitchen.",I knew at the outset I had to choose one of the two homes.  The cost to rent was the same for both and  was not a factor.  I chose to make a solid heat/ac system a must and hopefully a decent/nice kitchen.  Every other aspect fell in line after these two important features. As a single person I viewed the size of the home as not a critical factor nor the yare.  Schools can be an indicator of the area but having no kids it falls down the list.  I had to factor what I could and could not live with.

I'm single and don't have much stuff, so house size meant nothing to me either (as long as it was over 650 sq/ft). and I don't care when a house was built - I'm just renting not buying. I do have dogs, so if a house had 0 yard that choice was eliminated. After that I thought about which factors would impact me the most/most often. To me those were noise and traffic. I hate driving (and am a nervous driver on the rare occasions I do drive) so low - moderate traffic was a priority. And I like to spend time outside, and like quiet at night. So noise pollution would be pretty much a constant bother for me, and sow low- moderate noise was a big factor. Overall ""outside"" elements weighed more heavily  - noise, traffic, yard size, distance to park. The one combo that altered that was very bad kitchen and very bad HVAC. I didn't like picking a house that had the lowest rating for both of those, as it seemed like those combined might make for a bad indoor experience. Kitchen was more important than HVAC as kitchen would be a daily thing, whereas in my experience HVAC only comes into play about 6-7 months a year. But overall it was a gestalt - enough good things that were really good could outweigh almost any of the moderate good factors. Except 0 yard - no yard was a no go.","I would say it mostly stays the same. But I might emphasize more how the gestalt was pretty important, but a bit fluid depending on how good my most preferred factors were rated and how poorly the other factors were. Sometimes the combo could end up meaning that I picked the house with the lowest possible rating for my most important factors (noise and traffic) if everything else was perfect. And I might mention that I didn't always thinks of each rating on the rating scale separately. For example in most cases ""moderate"": was good enough, so anything moderate and above (or below if we are talking negative factors like noise and traffic) weighed about the same. Unless I needed a ""tie-breaker"",","Because I consciously thought about my choices when I made them, and mentally figured out why I was doing what I was doing as I made the choices.

At first, I looked at multiple factors, including Quality of Heat/AC System, Noise Pollution, Traffic, and School System Reputation and tried to extrapolate what this location might be like. For example, an area with a low School System Reputation may also have a high poverty rate and have less access to grocery stores and things like that; an area with high Noise Pollution but low Traffic scores likely indicates industrial noise, such as nearby factories, an airport, train tracks. However, I then realized I don't care that much about school systems and there are too many factors involved in school rankings and also that noise pollution is a modifiable problem â€” in fact at this very moment, I live in a very small apartment right over a busy road with much commerce and loud noises all day and night, but it doesn't bother me because high quality ear plugs exist. AC/Heating systems on the other hand are expensive, difficult, and (for renters) maybe even impossible to alter and have a huge impact on quality of life.

Nothing worse than a furnace going out in the middle of winter or an air conditioner not working in the heat of summer.  It can take 3 days to a week or longer to replace a HVAC System. So, that was my first priority. 

2)  My next consideration was the kitchen.  If the HVAC is good, but the kitchen is bad, I feel I can do quite a bit to get the kitchen looking and functioning better to my needs.  

3)  Size of home was a consideration, but not a priority.  It is just my husband and I so we can go with a smaller home if the HVAC system is good.

4) The noise level is a slight consideration, but we can also play music or keep TV on to get around this.

5)  The year of the home is a slight consideration, however, we are only renting.  I would be much more concerned if we were buying.

6)  The yard size does not matter much to us.  We are gone quite a bit from home.  A yard is nice, but not critical, as we do not have children living at home, and we do not entertain much.

7)  Schools and rating of education does not matter to us as our children are grown and do not live at home.

8)  Living near a park is nice, but since our children are not living at home we most likely would not use the park, so it does not matter how close or far it is.","No, I still have the same strategy as I wrote about before.  My number one concern was the HVAC System, but it was not exactly strategy E (only 1 single feature considered) as I did want a nice kitchen but willing to settle if HVAC System good.

I also didn't care too much about size of yard and size of house, since I live alone and I've lived in both tiny apartments and large homes and could adapt to either. So, I cared most about the kitchen. I've lived in places with horrible kitchens and it really makes life depressing. It seemed that the trade-off was usually a moderate to good kitchen meant the heating and 
AC was bad, and that was not fun. But, I figured I could always use portable electric heaters in the winter and big fans in the summer, as that would be worth it to not have a gross kitchen. I think every now and then I chose to go with better heating/AC, but most of the time it was the kitchen that was the deal breaker.

If 2 of the 3 factors favored one home, I typically selected that home, unless the differences were not great (ie a 200 sq ft difference in space).

I always preferred newer homes, especially if the difference was greater than approximately 40 years. I also occasionally looked at kitchen quality as a final separator.

The second most important factor was noise pollution.

It drove me crazy. So my next criteria was Noise Pollution. I didn't want to live anywhere with high noise pollution, unless the alternative was a house with no yard.

The next most important factor was yard or house size.

The next most important was traffic. I would prefer to live in an area with low traffic.

A/C, kitchen quality and school reputation had no bearing on my answers. I do not have kids so the school doesn't matter, and I feel the A/C and kitchen are things you can fix up after you buy a house.

The closeness to a park didn't really matter either, as even a 30 minute drive isn't too far in my opinion.

If I was to rent somewhere like the South, where it is exceptionally humid in the summer, or the desert Southwest, where it is well over 100 degrees for several months a year, I would definitely place a much higher priority on having a good AC system.

Meaning, first, I looked at the features that were dealbreakers and I eliminated those. The two dealbreakers were: a home that was about 900 square feet and under, and a home without any yard space. There were some instances when I overlooked the size of the home though, such as when the larger home didn't have a yard, along with the combination of a bad kitchen and A/C and Heating System. I also looked at the age of the home, and with that combo, I was able to make my choice. Every now and then, I would decide the home was too old if it didn't have desirable features. As far as the other features, for myself, a good school nearby is irrelevant. Noise pollution is something I would prefer not to have, but I paid much less attention to that one. Same with the distance to the park. However, I did sometimes consider the level of traffic if I couldn't make a proper decision. I obviously prefer the least amount of traffic, but it's not a dealbreaker. Sometimes there would be a cluster of great features that I couldn't pass up, like a huge yard. Not all of my choices were created equal, but this was the technique I tried to follow as much as I could. Every once and I while, when I couldn't decide, I would go with my gut instinct.","My strategy would not have changed at all. I would have still used the process of elimination to eliminate the features that are least desirable, then I would compare them to each home. If there are dealbreakers, like a home that was too small or a home with no yard, then I would compare them to features such as kitchen quality, A/C and Heater quality, and the age of the house. Light traffic and low noise pollution are good, but of two, I preferred light traffic. Closeness to parks isn't a big feature I care about, but it's a bonus. School rating is irrelevant. But unless the home doesn't have a yard, the size is a big deal for me. I've lived in a 700 square feet apartment and it was awful, so that has shaped my opinion. If I had to add any other unmentioned feature that is important, I would say bathroom quality, along with size and possibly the number of bathrooms are something I would have taken into consideration, if they were offered on the list. Anyway though, like I said, I wouldn't change my technique.","I answered them by looking at the provided information that I read.

I don't care about square footage because, or poor quality of the kitchen or size of yard. You can renovate and add an addition. If I live in the city, maybe I don't want a yard to maintain, and high noise levels are part of the charm of city life. 
When the schools were rated moderate to very good, then I considered proximity to parks and size of home. ","In searching for a home, buyers will have to compromise between what they want and what's available and what they can afford. I go into it based on looking for the best house in the neighborhood with the best nearby schools. I will stick by that unless I have the dream option of multiple choices of homes near more than one good school. That's where people want to live, and resale values are most likely higher in these neighborhoods.

I wanted to get that out of the way, early on, if nothing else than to be consistent.  There are a few things that I have a little influence over.  Crappy kitchen?  Hey, I can buy a stove or a new fridge.  Age of house?  I've seen well built houses that were built in 1900, and junk heaps that were built in 2011.  Obviously age can be a consideration, but it isn't necessarily a big deal.  So the main points were house size and yard size.  I can't make more yard space, and expanding house square footage isn't always practical or cheap.  So house and yard size really played a factor.

I can't just add more yard, and depending on a lot of factors, I may not be able to add on to the size of the house.  Everything is a trade off, but my general focus was on the yard and house size.  ","I'm going to try to answer this this way, and hope it's satisfactory.  We all make choices.  We make dozens of choices every day.  That's just how life is.

I'd prefer a larger yard over a smaller yard.  As far as how I know what my section one choice process was...  I've explained my priorities twice now.  It's the same way that, say I was presented with the choice of a chicken sandwich or a burger.  I like chicken, so I'd choose chicken.  I'm really not sure how else to explain this.

I don't have children myself, but I do value living in a neighborhood that makes education a priority. 

Next, I looked at the HVAC and kitchen quality. Of course, it's great if both are in good condition, but these weren't ideal houses so I was willing to sacrifice the quality of one of them. But not both - that would be too miserable. I slightly prefer good HVAC over a good kitchen, because I can cope with a bad kitchen, but I hate being too hot or too cold. New kitchens are nice but not essential.

Yard size is important to me, but all yards listed were much too small for my dog, so it didn't matter much to me if the choice was between 200 sq ft and 400 sq ft. (No yard - instant disqualification. Need a bit of space if the dog has to pee in the middle of the night.) Either way, there's just room for some outdoor furniture and a few plants. Small yards mean I'd be walking my dog to the park every day, but to me there's not much difference between a park that's 10 minutes away and one that's 30, because the point is to walk the dog so it's all dog mileage to me.

I live on a major street in an urban area, so I am used to lots of traffic and noise and I know how to cope with both. I'm not afraid of either, so that didn't factor in much.

I can live in 600 square feet, and I can live in 1800. It doesn't make much difference to me, except I wouldn't want a big house with bad HVAC because utilities would be too expensive.

","Yes, I have a much better understanding of how I processed my choices now. I understand that I preferred some aspects and ignored others. Of my preferred aspects, I weighted them, so that the Quality of Schools was the most important, but I'd give that up for a combination of other aspects that I found appealing. (example: The lure of a very good kitchen AND very good HVAC could have me moving to a neighborhood with bad schools.) If my preferences were bars in a graph, I would be able to combine some to give them more weight and create a longer bar.  ","After doing a few I got into a rhythm and checked the same things in the same order on every page. I had a mental checklist going and checked off each thing as I went. After doing that 100 times, the checklist was ingrained in my mind so all I had to do was replay it and think about why some of my choices were more important than others.

Noise doesn't bother me. Traffic doesn't bother me. The size of the house isn't important. I can deal with a bad kitchen, but a good kitchen would be nice. I prefer a yard, but if there is no yard that's okay. I don't care how far away the park is. ","It hasn't changed.

I cared most about the quality of the heat/AC system.

I cared about school reputation and kitchen quality.

Nothing was really a deal breaker, but I usually tried to avoid a bad heat/AC system.","I'm confused about this question. I remember first looking for AC/heat quality.

In real life, I don't have just a few seconds to make a decision about renting a home, so I would more thoroughly go over all of those characteristics, But in every case I would want the best heating and cooling system I could possibly get. If I had properties that both had excellent heating and cooling systems, meaning they worked well and they were energy efficient and low cost to operate, then the next thing would probably be size of the house quality of the kitchen Amount of noise And close distance to work. But that would have been the same earlier. It's just I didn't have time to take those things into account. And generally the choices were between not very good and either moderate or very good heating system. So I'm always going to go with the moderate, or very good heating system over a bad or not so good heating system.","It was a very conscious decision on my part. I felt like I was given a pretty impossible task and the way to simplify it would be and what I would really do in real life is always choose what's going to save me the most money and make the whole most comfortable in terms of heating and cooling.

School Quality.
Kitchen.
Noise Pollution.
Traffic.
Year Completed.
Proximity to Parks.
HVAC.
Yard Size.
House Size.

I eventually noted, I assigned my highest priority to Kitchen and HVAC qualities.
Of least importance was Year Completed (as its relevance was never explained).

Actually, let me rank these attributes here, from ascending order, for you:

1.) HVAC
2.) Kitchen
3.) Traffic
4.) Closest School's Quality
5.) Noise Pollution
6.) House Size
7.) Yard Size
8.) Proximity to Parks
9.) Year Completed

But!!

Attributes 3 - 7 were also interchangeable â€” especially when you forced my hand, with the kitchen / HVAC system.

I'm not *really* a yard person, and I'm not really trying to be cleaning up a large house by myself.

Parks are nice, but not a necessity for someone with my current set of preferences.

Traffic?  If my home is nice enough, I believe I can deal with that caveat.

Schools â€” I don't have children.
So, at best, a school's relative distance for me, comes into play as far as whether the children who attend it are bad or good eggs.

Noise pollution.
If I can avoid it, I would.
Of course..
..If there's already noise polluting my surroundings, maybe I can counter it with some of my own?","No.
There is no change, in particular.
